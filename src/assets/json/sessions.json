For example, if a Neanderthal man is attacked by a saber-toothed tiger, he may be most likely to survive by fleeing and avoiding the tiger in fear. By increasing one’s ability to detect danger and preparing one’s body for fight or flight, anxiety helps people manage threats to the lives, health, or well-being of themselves or others. A moderate level of anxiety increases attention, concentration, and performance."

For people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), these thoughts and routines occur repeatedly, feel difficult to stop, and consume a large amount of time. Their obsessions can involve fears of contamination or poisoning, religious themes, doubts, and thoughts of sex. Compulsions are often desperate attempts to neutralize the obsession and anxiety, and involve behaviors such as repeatedly washing, checking, counting, or touching things."

Some particular incidents have never left her mind, such as the horrifying sight of Ben, a close friend, being shot to death. She has returned to civilian life, but images from battle run repeatedly through her mind and disrupt her focus. Smelling gasoline at a gas station brings back memories that sometimes feel so real she feels she is back in combat. Sophie also jumps at any loud noise, as if she were preparing herself for battle.",

                      "Terrible events can cause extreme feelings of helplessness, horror, and fear. These events might include physical or sexual assault, car accidents, natural disasters, robbery, and war. People with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develop anxiety and intrusive thoughts about the event and may feel at times as though the event were happening again. They often are easy to startle and experience nightmares, anger outbursts, feelings of detachment, and hopelessness. PTSD can occur within one month of the event, or it may be delayed for many years after the trauma."
