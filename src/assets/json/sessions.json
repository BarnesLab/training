For example, if a Neanderthal man is attacked by a saber-toothed tiger, he may be most likely to survive by fleeing and avoiding the tiger in fear. By increasing one’s ability to detect danger and preparing one’s body for fight or flight, anxiety helps people manage threats to the lives, health, or well-being of themselves or others. A moderate level of anxiety increases attention, concentration, and performance."

Most people can think of a particular object or situation that they would prefer to avoid. For people with specific phobia, the fear is persistent or their avoiding the cause of the fear is impairing. People with specific phobia recognize that their fear is excessive, but they are unable to control the fear and may have a panic attack when encountering the feared object or situation."

People with these genetic influences are prone to experience anxiety more intensely and frequently and are more likely to develop a disorder.2",

For example, researchers have found out that brain regions associated with fear and stress reactions are more sensitive and show greater activation in people with anxiety disorders.3 In addition, imbalances of certain stress hormones or neurotransmitters can also contribute to the development of anxiety disorders."

Researchers have found that when people tend to think that they cannot control stressful events in their lives, they experience more anxiety. This perceived lack of control can be influenced by early childhood experiences, such as experiencing abuse, illness, or an over- or under-protective parenting style.4",
                      "These early childhood experiences can lead to negative core beliefs about oneself or the world (e.g., “No one will ever like me” or “The world is a dangerous place”). Although people often are unaware of these beliefs, the beliefs can affect how people interpret situations, where they focus their attention, and what they remember. For example, people who enter a party with the belief “No one will ever like me” may focus on unfriendly faces, interpret them as evidence of rejection, and remember them more clearly than friendly faces. These cognitive distortions can lead one to feel more anxiety, and if one is prone to respond to anxiety with inflexible coping strategies (e.g., avoiding all parties), one’s anxiety is likely to become even stronger.5"

                      "While biological and psychological influences can make one vulnerable to anxiety, the social environment can contribute to the focus of a person’s anxiety and help explain why different people experience anxiety in different situations. People can learn to fear certain situations by watching other people such as caregivers or friends behave fearfully in those situations or by being told information that suggests the situations are dangerous.6 Such learning experiences can influence the development of one’s beliefs and perceived control. For example, if a girl’s mother is very afraid of dogs and the girl sees her mother avoid them, the girl may come to believe that dogs are dangerous and should be avoided, even if the girl liked dogs before."

                      "Once anxiety disorders develop, why do they persist for many people? The main reason is that people understandably try to escape from their strong feelings of anxiety as fast as possible by avoiding feared objects or situations or engaging in safety behaviors that make them feel safer. For example, a person with social phobia might avoid public speaking altogether or give a talk only when she can wear black clothes so that no one would notice her sweating.",
                      "Even though avoidance and safety behavior can decrease anxiety in the moment, when people rely on these strategies they do not learn that the object or situation they fear is not dangerous. They also do not learn that the anxiety will decrease on its own after a while and that they can handle their feelings with more adaptive coping skills. Finally, they do not have the chance to correct their cognitive distortions. As a result, their anxiety persists. For example, as long as a person with social phobia avoids other people, the person will not have the chance to correct a belief such as “No one will ever like me.” In turn, such beliefs and cognitive distortions only increase the likelihood that the person will keep avoiding others and using safety behavior.1"
