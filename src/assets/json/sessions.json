              "Anxiety is a useful emotion, especially from an evolutionary point of view. Shaped by natural selection, anxiety helps us survive dangerous situations. For example, if a Neanderthal man is attacked by a saber-toothed tiger, he may be most likely to survive by fleeing and avoiding the tiger in fear. By increasing one’s ability to detect danger and preparing one’s body for fight or flight, anxiety helps people manage threats to the lives, health, or well-being of themselves or others. A moderate level of anxiety increases attention, concentration, and performance."
