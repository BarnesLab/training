For example, people who enter a party with the belief “No one will ever like me” may focus on unfriendly faces, interpret them as evidence of rejection, and remember them more clearly than friendly faces. These cognitive distortions can lead one to feel more anxiety, and if one is prone to respond to anxiety with inflexible coping strategies (e.g., avoiding all parties), one’s anxiety is likely to become even stronger.5"

People can learn to fear certain situations by watching other people such as caregivers or friends behave fearfully in those situations or by being told information that suggests the situations are dangerous.6 Such learning experiences can influence the development of one’s beliefs and perceived control. For example, if a girl’s mother is very afraid of dogs and the girl sees her mother avoid them, the girl may come to believe that dogs are dangerous and should be avoided, even if the girl liked dogs before."

Finally, they do not have the chance to correct their cognitive distortions. As a result, their anxiety persists. For example, as long as a person with social phobia avoids other people, the person will not have the chance to correct a belief such as “No one will ever like me.” In turn, such beliefs and cognitive distortions only increase the likelihood that the person will keep avoiding others and using safety behavior.1"

For example, one half of depressed people also report an anxiety disorder in their lifetime, and one-quarter-to-one-half of people with an anxiety disorder have also had a lifetime substance use disorder. It may be that depression and substance abuse develop as a consequence of anxious people’s isolating themselves and trying to escape from their symptoms by using alcohol or drugs.1",

This is true even if people approach feared situations step by step and start with smaller fears. It is not necessary to face one’s biggest fear from the start. In addition, people typically fear things more than their danger warrants, but when people do not approach these things, they do not learn their real danger.",
