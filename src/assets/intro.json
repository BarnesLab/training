        "The CalmThinking program includes five sessions. You will complete one session each week, and each session takes about 15 minutes or fewer to complete. You will also complete some assessments as part of our research study so we can evaluate how well the program works.",
        "You will receive feedback after completing the study about how your thinking has changed over the course of the program. You can do the sessions anywhere; all you need is a quiet place and a device with Internet. This program is free and can be completed without ever leaving your desk.",

        "We are attempting to change your understanding of anxiety to alter your anxious thinking. In each session, you will be asked to read brief information and complete questions by filling in whether statements are true or false. The task is not meant to be tricky or too difficult."

        "The exercises are designed to change your understanding of anxiety by giving you information about the anxiety topics below and asking you questions about it. The program can feel a little repetitive, but the repetition is important so you develop a new understanding.",
        "Do not worry if you do not use online interventions muchâ€”the tasks are not designed to be difficult, and you can always email us with questions at studyteam@mindtrails.org.",
        "This is an experimental program, so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research shows that this program may be able to alter anxious thinking as effectively as some forms of therapy. We want to learn whether it can be helpful for you."
